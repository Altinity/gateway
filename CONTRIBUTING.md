When creating a bug report, please include:

- A clear, descriptive title.
- A reproducible test case or detailed step-by-step instructions.
- The exact version of the software you are using.
- Relevant environment details (operating system, browser, deployment specifics).
- Details about any modifications you've made related to the issue.

## Contributing via Pull Requests

We highly value contributions via pull requests. Before submitting a pull request, ensure:

- You have forked the repository and are working against the latest code on the `main` branch.
- Your changes have a corresponding open issue or you've created one for discussion.
- Your contribution addresses only a specific issue or feature.
- All tests pass locally.

### Submitting a Pull Request:

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Create a clear, descriptive branch name (e.g., `fix-issue-123` or `feature-improved-authentication`).
3. Implement your changes, minimizing unrelated modifications (e.g., avoid unnecessary code formatting).
4. Write clear, concise commit messages that reference the relevant issue.
5. Ensure your changes pass all local tests.
6. Submit the pull request, providing detailed descriptions, referencing associated issues, and responding thoroughly to all automated CI checks and reviewer comments.

GitHub documentation on [forking](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and [creating pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests) may assist you further.

## Finding Contributions to Work On

Looking through our existing issues is an excellent way to identify tasks. We regularly use GitHub's standard labels, including:

- `help wanted`: Ideal for first-time contributors.
- `enhancement`: New feature suggestions.
- `bug`: Known issues requiring fixes.

We encourage new contributors to start with `help wanted` issues.
